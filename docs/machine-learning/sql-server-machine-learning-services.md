# What is SQL Server Machine Learning Services with Python and R?
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2017 SQL MI](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2017-asdbmi.md)]

Machine Learning Services is a feature in SQL Server that gives the ability to run Python and R scripts with relational data. You can use open-source packages and frameworks, and the [Microsoft Python and R packages](#packages), for predictive analytics and machine learning. The scripts are executed in-database without moving data outside SQL Server or over the network. This article explains the basics of SQL Server Machine Learning Services and how to get started.

For machine learning on other SQL platforms, see the [SQL machine learning documentation](index.yml).

## Execute Python and R scripts in SQL Server

SQL Server Machine Learning Services lets you execute Python and R scripts in-database. You can use it to prepare and clean data, do feature engineering, and train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models within a database. The feature runs your scripts where the data resides and eliminates transfer of the data across the network to another server.

You can execute Python and R scripts on a SQL Server instance with the stored procedure [sp_execute_external_script](../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).

Base distributions of Python and R are included in Machine Learning Services. You can install and use open-source packages and frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, in addition to the Microsoft packages.

Machine Learning Services uses an extensibility framework to run Python and R scripts in SQL Server. Learn more about how this works:

+ [Python extension](concepts/extension-python.md)
+ [R extension](concepts/extension-r.md)

## Get started with Machine Learning Services

::: moniker range=">=sql-server-ver15||>=sql-server-linux-ver15"
1. [Install SQL Server Machine Learning Services on Windows](install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md) or [on Linux](../linux/sql-server-linux-setup-machine-learning.md?toc=/sql/machine-learning/toc.json). You can also use [Machine Learning Services on Big Data Clusters](../big-data-cluster/machine-learning-services.md) and [Machine Learning Services in Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/machine-learning-services-overview).

1. Configure your development tools. You can use [run Python and R scripts in Azure Data Studio notebooks](install/sql-machine-learning-azure-data-studio.md). You can also run T-SQL in [Azure Data Studio](../azure-data-studio/what-is-azure-data-studio.md).

## Python and R packages

You can use open-source packages and frameworks, in addition to Microsoft's enterprise packages. Most common open-source Python and R packages are pre-installed in Machine Learning Services. The following Python and R packages from Microsoft are also included:

| Language | Package | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Python | [revoscalepy](python/ref-py-revoscalepy.md) | The primary package for scalable Python. Data transformations and manipulation, statistical summarization, visualization, and many forms of modeling. Additionally, functions in this package automatically distribute workloads across available cores for parallel processing. |
| Python | [microsoftml](python/ref-py-microsoftml.md) | Adds machine learning algorithms to create custom models for text analysis, image analysis, and sentiment analysis. | 
| R | [RevoScaleR](r/ref-r-revoscaler.md) | The primary package for scalable R. Data transformations and manipulation, statistical summarization, visualization, and many forms of modeling. Additionally, functions in this package automatically distribute workloads across available cores for parallel processing. |
| R | [MicrosoftML (R)](r/ref-r-microsoftml.md) | Adds machine learning algorithms to create custom models for text analysis, image analysis, and sentiment analysis. |
| R | [olapR](r/ref-r-olapr.md) | R functions used for MDX queries against a SQL Server Analysis Services OLAP cube. |
| R | [sqlrutils](r/ref-r-sqlrutils.md) | A mechanism to use R scripts in a T-SQL stored procedure, register that stored procedure with a database, and run the stored procedure from an [R development environment](r/set-up-a-data-science-client.md). |
| R | [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/rro) | Microsoft R Open (MRO) is the enhanced distribution of R from Microsoft. It is a complete open-source platform for statistical analysis and data science. It is based on and 100% compatible with R, and includes additional capabilities for improved performance and reproducibility. |
