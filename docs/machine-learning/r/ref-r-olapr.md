# olapR (R package in SQL Server Machine Learning Services)
[!INCLUDE [SQL Server 2016 and later](../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2016.md)]

**olapR** is an R package from Microsoft used for MDX queries against a SQL Server Analysis Services OLAP cube. Functions do not support all MDX operations, but you can build queries that slice, dice, drilldown, rollup, and pivot on dimensions. The package is included in [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../sql-server-machine-learning-services.md) and [SQL Server 2016 R Services](sql-server-r-services.md).

You can use this package on connections to an Analysis Services OLAP cube on all supported versions of SQL Server. Connections to a tabular model are not supported at this time.

## Load package

The **olapR** package is not preloaded into an R session. Run the following command to load the package.

```R
library(olapR)
```

## Package version

Current version is 1.0.0 in all Windows-only products and downloads providing the package.

## Full reference documentation

The **olapr** package is distributed in multiple Microsoft products, but usage is the same whether you get the package in SQL Server or another product. Because the functions are the same, [documentation for individual sqlrutils functions](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/olapr/olapr) is published to just one location under the [R reference](/machine-learning-server/r-reference/introducing-r-server-r-package-reference) for Microsoft Machine Learning Server. Should any product-specific behaviors exist, discrepancies will be noted in the function help page.
