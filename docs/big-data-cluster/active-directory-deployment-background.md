# Deploy multiple [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] in the same Active Directory domain

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

This article explains the updates to SQL Server 2019 CU5 that enables the capability for multiple SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters to be deployed and integrated with the same Active Directory Domain.

Prior to SQL 2019 CU5 there were two issues preventing deployment of multiple BDCs in an AD domain.

- Naming conflict for service principal names and DNS domain
- Domain account principal names

## Object name collisions

### Service principal names (SPN) and DNS domain naming conflict

The domain name provided at deployment time is used as AD DNS domain. This means the pods can connect to each other in the internal network using this DNS domain. Additionally, users connect to the BDC endpoints using this DNS domain. As a result, any Service Principal Name (SPN) created for a service within BDC is going to have the Kubernetes pod, service, or endpoint name qualified with this AD DNS domain. If a user deploys a second cluster in the domain, the SPNs being generated will have the same FQDN since the pod names as well as the DNS domain name do not differ between the two clusters. As an example, consider a case where the AD DNS domain is `contoso.local`. One of the SPNs generated for master pool SQL Server in pod `master-0` would be `MSSQLSvc/master-0.contoso.local:1433`. In the second cluster the user would attempt to deploy, the pod name for `master-0` is the same and the user will provide the same AD DNS domain (``contoso.local``) resulting in the same SPN string. Active Directory would forbid creation of a conflicting SPN leading to a deployment failure for the second cluster.

### Domain account principal names

During a deployment of BDC with an Active Directory domain, multiple account principals are generated for services running inside the BDC. These are essentially AD user accounts. Prior to SQL 2019 CU5 the names for these account would not be unique between clusters. This manifests in an attempt to create the same user account name for a particular service in BDC in two different clusters. The cluster that is being deployed second will run into a conflict in AD and cannot create their account.

## Resolution for collisions

### Solution to solve the problem with SPNs and DNS domain - SQL 2019 CU5

Since SPNs must differ in any two clusters, the DNS domain name passed in at deployment time must be different. You can specify different DNS names using the newly introduced setting in the deployment configuration file: `subdomain`. If the subdomain differs between two clusters and internal communication can happen over this subdomain, the SPNs will include the subdomain achieving the required uniqueness.

>[!NOTE]
>The value passed through the subdomain setting is not a new AD domain, but a DNS domain that is used internally.

As an example, consider the case of a master pool SQL Server SPN again. If the subdomain is `bdc`, the previously discussed SPN will change to `MSSQLSvc/master-0.bdc.contoso.local:1433`.  

Customizing the value of the newly introduced subdomain parameter in the  active directory configuration spec is optional. By default, the BDC cluster name or namespace name will be used to compute the value of subdomain setting. When users want to override the subdomain name, they can do so using the new subdomain parameter being introduced in the active directory configuration spec.

### Solution to solve the problem regarding account names uniqueness

In order to update the account names to a scheme that guarantees uniqueness we introduced the concept of account prefix. The account prefix is a portion of the account name that is unique between any two clusters. The remaining portion of the account name is constant for a given service. The new format of the account name will look like `<prefix>-<name>-<podId>`. 

>[!NOTE]
>Active Directory requires the account names to be limited to 20 characters. BDC cluster needs to use 8 of the characters for distinguishing pods and StatefulSets. This leaves us 12 characters as a limit for the account prefix

Customizing the account name is optional. Use the `accountPrefix` parameter in the active directory configuration spec. SQL Server 2019 CU5 introduces `accountPrefix` in the configuration spec. By default, the subdomain name is used as the account prefix. If the subdomain name is longer than the 12 characters, the initial 12-characters substring of the subdomain name are used as account prefix.

The subdomain only applies to DNS. Hence the new LDAP user account name is `bdc-ldap@contoso.local`. The account name would not be  not `bdc-ldap@bdc.contoso.local`.

## Semantics

In summary, these are the semantics of the parameters added in SQL 2019 CU5 for multiple clusters in a domain:

### `subdomain`

- Optional field
- Data type: string
- Definition: A unique DNS subdomain to use for this BDC cluster. This value should be different for each cluster deployed in the Active Directory domain.  
- Default value: When not provided, cluster name will be used as the default value
- Maximum length: 63 characters per label (label being each string separated by a dot).
- Remarks: The endpoint DNS names should use the subdomain in their FQDN.

### `accountPrefix`

- Optional field
- Data type: string
- Definition: A unique prefix for AD accounts BDC cluster will generate. This value should be different for each cluster deployed in the Active Directory domain.
- Default value: When not provided, subdomain name will be used as the default value. When subdomain is not provided, cluster name will be used as the subdomain name, and hence cluster name will be inherited as accountPrefix as well. If the subdomain is provided and is a multipart name (contains one or more dots), user must provide an accountPrefix. 
- Maximum length: 12 characters 

## Impact on AD domain and DNS server 

There are no change required in the AD domain or domain controller to accommodate deploying multiple BDCs against the same Active Directory domain. The DNS subdomain will be automatically created in the DNS server when registering external endpoint DNS names. 

## Impact on setting up the deployment configuration file used for the BDC deployment 

The *activeDirectory* section in the control plane configuration *control.json* will have two new optional parameters: `subdomain` and `accountPrefix`. Only provide values for these settings if you want to override the default behavior, which is to use the cluster name for each of them. The cluster name is the same as namespace name.

Additionally, you can use endpoint DNS names of your choice as long as they are fully qualified and do not conflict between any two big data clusters deployed in the same domain. Optionally, you can use the subdomain parameter value to ensure DNS names are different across clusters.  As an example, consider the gateway endpoint. If you want to use the name `gateway` for the endpoint and register it in the DNS server automatically as part of BDC deployment, use `gateway.bdc1.contoso.local` as the DNS name. If `bdc1` is the subdomain and `contoso.local` is the AD DNS domain name. Other acceptable values are: `gateway-bdc1.contoso.local` or simply `gateway.contoso.local`.

## Examples

Below is an example of active directory security configuration, in case you want to override subdomain and accountPrefix. 

```json
    "security": { 
        "activeDirectory": { 
            "ouDistinguishedName":"OU=contosoou,DC=contoso,DC=local", 
            "dnsIpAddresses": [ "10.10.10.10" ], 
            "domainControllerFullyQualifiedDns": [ "contoso-win2016-dc.contoso.local" ], 
            "domainDnsName":"contoso.local", 
            "subdomain": "bdc", 
            "accountPrefix": "myprefix", 
            "clusterAdmins": [ "contosoadmins" ], 
            "clusterUsers": [ "contosousers1", "contosousers2" ] 
        } 
    } 
  
```

Below is an example of endpoint spec for control plane endpoints. You can use any values for DNS names, as long as they are unique and fully qualified:
  
```json
        "endpoints": [ 
            { 
                "serviceType": "NodePort", 
                "port": 30080, 
                "name": "Controller", 
                "dnsName": "control-bdc1.contoso.local" 
            }, 
            { 
                "serviceType": "NodePort", 
                "port": 30777, 
                "name": "ServiceProxy", 
                "dnsName": "monitor-bdc1.contoso.local" 
            } 
        ] 
  
```

## Questions

### Do you need to create separate OUs for different clusters?

It is not required, but is recommended. Providing separate OUs for separate clusters helps you manage the generated user accounts.

### How to revert back to the pre-CU5 behavior in SQL 2019?

There might be scenarios where you can't accommodate the newly introduced `subdomain` parameter. For example you must deploy a pre-CU5 release and you already upgraded [!INCLUDE [azure-data-cli-azdata](../includes/azure-data-cli-azdata.md)]. This is highly unlikely, but if you need to revert to the pre-CU5 behavior you can set `useSubdomain` parameter to `false` in the active directory section of `control.json`.

The following example sets `useSubdomain` to `false` for this scenario.

```console
azdata bdc config replace -c custom-prod-kubeadm/control.json -j "$.security.activeDirectory.useSubdomain=false" 
```
