# What is application deployment on a SQL Server big data cluster?

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

Application deployment enables the deployment of applications on a SQL Server big data cluster by providing interfaces to create, manage, and run applications. Applications deployed on a SQL Server big data cluster benefit from the computational power of the cluster and can access the data that is available on the cluster. This increases scalability and performance of the applications, while managing the applications where the data lives. The supported application runtimes on [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] are R, Python, SSIS, MLeap.

The following sections describe the architecture and functionality of application deployment.

## Application deployment architecture

Application deployment consists of a controller and app runtime handlers. When creating an application, a specification file (`spec.yaml`) is provided. This `spec.yaml` file contains everything the controller needs to know to successfully deploy the application. The following is a sample of the contents for `spec.yaml`:

```yaml
#spec.yaml
name: add-app #name of your python script
version: v1  #version of the app
runtime: Python #the language this app uses (R or Python)
src: ./add.py #full path to the location of the app
entrypoint: add #the function that will be called upon execution
replicas: 1  #number of replicas needed
poolsize: 1  #the pool size that you need your app to scale
inputs:  #input parameters that the app expects and the type
  x: int
  y: int
output: #output parameter the app expects and the type
  result: int
```

The controller inspects the `runtime` specified in the `spec.yaml` file and calls the corresponding runtime handler. The runtime handler creates the application. First, a Kubernetes ReplicaSet is created containing one or more pods, each of which contains the application to be deployed. The number of pods is defined by the `replicas` parameter set in the `spec.yaml` file for the application. Each pod can have one of more pools. The number of pools is defined by the `poolsize` parameter set in the `spec.yaml` file.

These settings have an impact on the amount of requests the deployment can handle in parallel. The maximum number of requests at one given time is equals to `replicas` times `poolsize`. If you have 5 replicas and 2 pools per replica the deployment can handle 10 requests in parallel. See the image below for a graphical representation of `replicas` and `poolsize`:

After the ReplicaSet has been created and the pods have started, a cron job is created if a `schedule` was set in the `spec.yaml` file. Finally, a Kubernetes Service is created that can be used to manage and run the application (see below).

When an application is executed, the Kubernetes service for the application proxies the requests to a replica and returns the results.

## <a id="app-deploy-security"></a> Security considerations for applications deployments on OpenShift

SQL Server 2019 CU5 enables support for Big Data Clusters deployment on Red Hat OpenShift as well as an updated security model for BDC so privileged containers no longer required. In addition to non-privileged, containers are running as non-root user by default for all new deployments using SQL Server 2019 CU5.

At the time of the CU5 release, the setup step of the applications deployed with [app deploy]() interfaces will still run as *root* user. This is required since during setup  additional packages that application will use are installed. Other user code deployed as part of the application will run as low privilege user. 

In addition, **CAP_AUDIT_WRITE** capability is an optional capability necessary to allow scheduling SSIS applications using cron jobs. When the application’s yaml specification file specifies a schedule, the application will be triggered via a cron job, which requires the additional capability.  Alternatively, the application can be triggered on demand with *azdata app run* through a web service call, which does not require the CAP_AUDIT_WRITE capability. 

> [!NOTE]
> The custom SCC in the [OpenShift deployment article](deploy-openshift.md) does not include this capability since it is not required by a default deployment of big data cluster. To enable this capability, you must first update the custom SCC yaml file to include CAP_AUDIT_WRITE in the 

```yml
...
allowedCapabilities:
- SETUID
- SETGID
- CHOWN
- SYS_PTRACE
- AUDIT_WRITE
...
```

## How to work with Application Deployment

The two main interfaces for application deployment are: 
- [Command line interface [!INCLUDE [azure-data-cli-azdata](../includes/azure-data-cli-azdata.md)]](app-create.md)
- [Visual Studio Code and Azure Data Studio extension](app-deployment-extension.md)

It is also possible for an application to be executed using a RESTful web service. For more information, see [Consume applications on big data clusters](app-consume.md).
