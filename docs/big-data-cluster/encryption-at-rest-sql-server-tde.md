# SQL Server Big Data Clusters transparent data encryption (TDE) at rest usage guide

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

This guide demonstrates how to use encryption at rest capabilities of SQL Server Big Data Clusters to encrypt databases.

Experience is in general the same as SQL Server on Linux and [standard TDE documentation](../relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption.md) applies except where noted. In order to monitor status of encryption on master, follow standard DMV query patterns on top of [`sys.dm_database_encryption_keys`](../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-database-encryption-keys-transact-sql.md) and [`sys.certificates`](../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-certificates-transact-sql.md).

__Unsupported features:__
* Data pool encryption

## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

- [SQL Server Big Data Cluster CU8+](release-notes-big-data-cluster.md)
- [Big data tools](deploy-big-data-tools.md)
   - **Azure Data Studio**
- SQL Server user with administrative privileges.

## Query the installed certificates

1. In Azure Data Studio, connect to the SQL Server master instance of your big data cluster. For more information, see [Connect to the SQL Server master instance](connect-to-big-data-cluster.md#master).

1. Double-click on the connection in the **Servers** window to show the server dashboard for the SQL Server master instance. Select **New Query**.

   ![SQL Server master instance query](./media/tutorial-data-pool-ingest-sql/sql-server-master-instance-query.png)

1. Run the following Transact-SQL command to change the context to the **master** database in the master instance.

   ```sql
   USE master
   GO
   ```

1. Query the installed system managed certificates. 

   ```sql
    SELECT TOP 1 name FROM sys.certificates WHERE name LIKE 'TDECertificate%' ORDER BY name DESC
   ```

    Use different query criteria as needed.

    The certificate name will be listed as “TDECertificate{timestamp}”. When you see a prefix of TDECertificate and followed by timestamp, this is the certificate provided by the system managed feature.

## Encrypt a database using the system provided certificate

In the following examples consider a database named __userdb__ as the target for encryption and a system provided certificate named __TDECertificate2020_09_15_22_46_27__ per output of previous section.

1. Use the following pattern to generate a database encryption key using the provided system certificate.

   ```sql
    USE userdb; 
    GO
    CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256 ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE TDECertificate2020_09_15_22_46_27;
    GO
   ```

1. Encrypt database __userdb__ with the following command.

   ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE userdb SET ENCRYPTION ON;
    GO
   ```
