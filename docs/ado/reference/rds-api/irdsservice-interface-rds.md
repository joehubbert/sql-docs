# IRDSService Interface (RDS)
Exposes the [InvokeService (RDS)](./invokeservice-rds.md) method, which is used to return a pointer to the requested interface on a more capable version of the object.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](/dotnet/framework/wcf/).
