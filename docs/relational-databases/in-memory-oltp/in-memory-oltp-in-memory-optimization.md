# In-Memory OLTP and Memory-Optimization

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server Azure SQL Database](../../includes/applies-to-version/sql-asdb.md)]

 [!INCLUDE[hek_2](../../includes/hek-2-md.md)] can significantly improve the performance of transaction processing, data ingestion and data load, and transient data scenarios.  To jump into the basic code and knowledge you need to quickly test your own memory-optimized table and natively compiled stored procedure, see
 -  [Quick Start 1: In-Memory OLTP Technologies for Faster Transact-SQL Performance](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/survey-of-initial-areas-in-in-memory-oltp.md).  
 
We have uploaded to YouTube a [**17-minute video**](#anchorname-17minute-video) explaining In-Memory OLTP on SQL Server, and demonstrating the performance benefits.

For a more detailed overview of In-Memory OLTP and a review of scenarios that see performance benefits from the technology:

- [Overview and Usage Scenarios](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/overview-and-usage-scenarios.md)
 
 Note that [!INCLUDE[hek_2](../../includes/hek-2-md.md)] is the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] technology for improving performance of transaction processing. For the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] technology that improves reporting and analytical query performance see [Columnstore Indexes Guide](../../relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview.md).
  
 Several improvements have been made to In-Memory OLTP in [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)], as well as in [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)]. The Transact-SQL surface area has been increased to make it easier to migrate database applications. Support for performing ALTER operations for memory-optimized tables and natively compiled stored procedures has been added, to make it easier to maintain applications.
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  **Try it out**  
>   
>  In-Memory OLTP is available in Premium and Business Critical tier Azure SQL databases and elastic pools. To get started with In-Memory OLTP, as well as Columnstore in Azure SQL Database, see [Optimize Performance using In-Memory Technologies in SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/in-memory-oltp-overview).

## <a name="anchorname-17minute-video"></a>17 minute video, indexed

- _Video title:_ &nbsp; **In-Memory OLTP in SQL Server 2016**
- _Published date:_ &nbsp; 2019-03-10, on `YouTube.com`.
- _Duration:_ &nbsp; 17:32 &nbsp; &nbsp; (See the following [**Index**](#anchorname-index-17minute-video) for links into the video.)
- _Hosted by:_ &nbsp; Jos de Bruijn, Senior Program Manager on SQL Server

### Demo can be downloaded

At the time mark 08:09, the video runs a demonstration twice. You can download the source code for runnable performance demo that is used in the video, from the following link:

- [In-Memory OLTP Performance Demo v1.0, source code](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/in-memory-oltp-demo-v1.0)

The general steps seen in the video are as follows:

1. First the demo is run with a regular table.
2. Next we see a memory-optimized edition of the table being created and populated by a few clicks in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS.exe).
3. Then the demo is rerun with the memory-optimized table. An enormous speed improvement is measured.

| &nbsp; &nbsp; [01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=63) | Modern hardware requires modern architecture of database system. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=130) | Explosion in data being generated; operations need to be instant (low latency). |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=199) | Reduce TCO - do more with the resources you have. |
| <br/>C.&nbsp; [03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=213) | <br/>What In-Memory OLTP is.<br/>Performance optimized using memory-optimized technology. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=303) | Up to 30X faster transaction processing. |

| &nbsp; &nbsp; [06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=375) | Fully integrated in SQL Server. Thus no new languages or tools to learn. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=442) | First released in SQL Server 2014, but major improvements in 2016. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=558) | Available in Azure SQL Database too (in the cloud). |
| <br/>D.&nbsp; [08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=489) | <br/>Performance demonstration.<br/> Run the demo with a regular table. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=551) | SSMS context menu: **Reports** &gt; **Transaction Performance Analysis** |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=638) | SSMS context menu: **Memory Optimization Advisor**<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; Actually create a memory-optimized table from a regular table, plus migrate the data. |
| &nbsp; &nbsp; [11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4&t=688) | Rerun the demo, see 45X speed improvement. |
