# AppContext switches in Sqlclient

[!INCLUDE [Driver_ADONET_Download](../../includes/driver_adonet_download.md)]

The AppContext class allows SqlClient to provide new functionality while continuing to support callers who depend on the previous behavior. Users can opt out of a change in behavior by setting specific AppContext switches.

## Enabling decimal truncation behavior

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-netfx-netcore-netst-md](../../includes/appliesto-netfx-netcore-netst-md.md)]

Starting with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 2.0, decimal data will be rounded by default, as is done by SQL Server. To enable the previous behavior of truncation, you can set the AppContext switch **"Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.TruncateScaledDecimal"** to `true` at application startup:

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.TruncateScaledDecimal", true);
```

## Enabling managed networking on Windows

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-xxxx-netcore-netst-md](../../includes/appliesto-xxxx-netcore-netst-md.md)]

On Windows, SqlClient uses a native implementation of the SNI network interface by default. To enable the use of a managed SNI implementation, you can set the AppContext switch **"Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.UseManagedNetworkingOnWindows"** to `true` at application startup:

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.UseManagedNetworkingOnWindows", true);
```

This switch will toggle the driver's behavior to use a managed networking implementation in .NET Core 2.1+ and .NET Standard 2.0+ projects on Windows, eliminating all dependencies on native libraries for the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient library. It is intended for testing and debugging purposes only.

> [!NOTE]
> There are some known differences when compared to the native implementation. For example, the managed implementation does not support non-domain Windows Authentication.

## Disabling Transparent Network IP Resolution

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-netfx-xxxx-xxxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-netfx-xxxx-xxxx-md.md)]

Transparent Network IP Resolution (TNIR) is a revision of the existing MultiSubnetFailover feature. TNIR affects the connection sequence of the driver in the case where the first resolved IP of the hostname does not respond and there are multiple IPs associated with the hostname. TNIR interacts with MultiSubnetFailover to provide the following three connection sequences:<br />
* 0: One IP is attempted, followed by all IPs in parallel
* 1: All IPs are attempted in parallel
* 2: All IPs are attempted one after another

|TransparentNetworkIPResolution|MultiSubnetFailover|Behavior|
|--------|--------|--------|
|True|True|1|
|True|False|0|
|False|True|1|
|False|False|2|

TransparentNetworkIPResolution is enabled by default. MultiSubnetFailover is disabled by default. To disable TNIR, you can set the AppContext switch **"Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.DisableTNIRByDefaultInConnectionString"** to `true` at application startup:

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.DisableTNIRByDefaultInConnectionString", true);
```

For more information about setting these properties, see the documentation for [SqlConnection.ConnectionString Property](/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring). 

## Enable a minimum timeout during login

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-netfx-xxxx-xxxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-netfx-xxxx-xxxx-md.md)]

To prevent a login attempt from waiting indefinitely, you can set the AppContext switch **Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.UseOneSecFloorInTimeoutCalculationDuringLogin** to `true` at application startup:

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.UseOneSecFloorInTimeoutCalculationDuringLogin", false);
```

## Disable blocking behavior of ReadAsync

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-netfx-xxxx-xxxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-netfx-xxxx-xxxx-md.md)]

By default, ReadAsync runs synchronously and blocks the calling thread on .NET Framework. To disable this blocking behavior, you can set the AppContext switch **Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.MakeReadAsyncBlocking** to `false` at application startup:

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Switch.Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.MakeReadAsyncBlocking", false);
```
