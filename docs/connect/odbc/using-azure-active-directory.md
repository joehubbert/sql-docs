# Using Azure Active Directory with the ODBC Driver
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

## Purpose

The Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server version 13.1 or above allows ODBC applications to connect to an instance of Azure SQL Database using a federated identity in Azure Active Directory with a username/password, an Azure Active Directory access token, an Azure Active Directory managed identity (17.3+), or Windows Integrated Authentication (17.6+ on Linux/macOS). For the ODBC Driver version 13.1, the Azure Active Directory access token authentication is _Windows only_. The ODBC Driver version 17 and above support this authentication across all platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS). A new Azure Active Directory interactive authentication with Login ID is introduced in ODBC Driver version 17.1 for Windows. A new Azure Active Directory managed identity authentication method was added in ODBC Driver version 17.3.1.1 for both system-assigned and user-assigned identities. All of these are accomplished through the use of new DSN and connection string keywords, and connection attributes.

> [!NOTE]
> The ODBC Driver on Linux and macOS before version 17.6 only supports Azure Active Directory authentication directly against Azure Active Directory. If you are using Azure Active Directory username/password authentication from a Linux or macOS client and your Active Directory configuration requires the client to authenticate against an Active Directory Federation Services endpoint, authentication may fail. As of driver version 17.6, this limitation has been removed.

## New and/or Modified DSN and Connection String Keywords

The `Authentication` keyword can be used when connecting with a DSN or connection string to control the authentication mode. The value set in the connection string overrides that in the DSN, if provided. The _pre-attribute value_ of the `Authentication` setting is the value computed from the connection string and DSN values.

|Name|Values|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`Authentication`|(not set), (empty string), `SqlPassword`, `ActiveDirectoryPassword`, `ActiveDirectoryIntegrated`, `ActiveDirectoryInteractive`, `ActiveDirectoryMsi`, `ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal` |(not set)|Controls the authentication mode.<table><tr><th>Value<th>Description<tr><td>(not set)<td>Authentication mode determined by other keywords (existing legacy connection options.)<tr><td>(empty string)<td>(Connection string only.) Override and unset an `Authentication` value set in the DSN.<tr><td>`SqlPassword`<td>Directly authenticate to a SQL Server instance using a username and password.<tr><td>`ActiveDirectoryPassword`<td>Authenticate with an Azure Active Directory identity using a username and password.<tr><td>`ActiveDirectoryIntegrated`<td>_Windows, and Linux/Mac 17.6+, driver only_. Authenticate with an Azure Active Directory identity using integrated authentication.<tr><td>`ActiveDirectoryInteractive`<td>_Windows driver only_. Authenticate with an Azure Active Directory identity using interactive authentication.<tr><td>`ActiveDirectoryMsi`<td>Authenticate with Azure Active Directory identity using managed identity authentication. For user-assigned identity, UID is set to the object ID of the user identity.<tr><td>`ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal`<td>(17.7+) Authenticate with Azure Active Directory identity using service principal authentication.</table>|
|`Encrypt`|(not set), `Yes`, `No`|(see description)|Controls encryption for a connection. If the pre-attribute value of the `Authentication` setting is not _none_ in the DSN or connection string, the default is `Yes`. Otherwise, the default is `No`. If the attribute `SQL_COPT_SS_AUTHENTICATION` overrides the pre-attribute value of `Authentication`, explicitly set the value of Encryption in the DSN or connection string or connection attribute. The pre-attribute value of Encryption is `Yes` if the value is set to `Yes` in either the DSN or connection string.|

## New and/or Modified Connection Attributes

The following pre-connect connection attributes have either been introduced or modified to support Azure Active Directory authentication. When a connection attribute has a corresponding connection string or DSN keyword and is set, the connection attribute takes precedence.

|Attribute|Type|Values|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|`SQL_COPT_SS_AUTHENTICATION`|`SQL_IS_INTEGER`|`SQL_AU_NONE`, `SQL_AU_PASSWORD`, `SQL_AU_AD_INTEGRATED`, `SQL_AU_AD_PASSWORD`, `SQL_AU_AD_INTERACTIVE`, `SQL_AU_AD_MSI`, `SQL_AU_AD_SPA`, `SQL_AU_RESET`|(not set)|See description of `Authentication` keyword above. `SQL_AU_NONE` is provided in order to explicitly override a set `Authentication` value in the DSN and/or connection string, while `SQL_AU_RESET` unsets the attribute if it was set, allowing the DSN or connection string value to take precedence.|
|`SQL_COPT_SS_ACCESS_TOKEN`|`SQL_IS_POINTER`|Pointer to `ACCESSTOKEN` or NULL|NULL|If non-null, specifies the AzureAD Access Token to use. It is an error to specify an access token and also `UID`, `PWD`, `Trusted_Connection`, or `Authentication` connection string keywords or their equivalent attributes. <br> **NOTE:** ODBC Driver version 13.1 only supports this on _Windows_.|
|`SQL_COPT_SS_ENCRYPT`|`SQL_IS_INTEGER`|`SQL_EN_OFF`, `SQL_EN_ON`|(see description)|Controls encryption for a connection. `SQL_EN_OFF` and `SQL_EN_ON` disable and enable encryption, respectively. If the pre-attribute value of the `Authentication` setting is not _none_ or `SQL_COPT_SS_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set, and `Encrypt` was not specified in either the DSN or connection string, the default is `SQL_EN_ON`. Otherwise, the default is `SQL_EN_OFF`. If the connection attribute `SQL_COPT_SS_AUTHENTICATION` is set to not _none_, explicitly set `SQL_COPT_SS_ENCRYPT` to the desired value if `Encrypt` was not specified in the DSN or connection string. The effective value of this attribute controls [whether encryption will be used for the connection.](../../relational-databases/native-client/features/using-encryption-without-validation.md)|
|`SQL_COPT_SS_OLDPWD`|\-|\-|\-|Not supported with Azure Active Directory, since password changes to Azure AD principals cannot be accomplished through an ODBC connection. <br><br>Password expiration for SQL Server Authentication was introduced in SQL Server 2005. The `SQL_COPT_SS_OLDPWD` attribute was added to allow the client to provide both the old and the new password for the connection. When this property is set, the provider will not use the connection pool for the first connection or for subsequent connections, since the connection string will contain the "old password", which has now changed.|
|`SQL_COPT_SS_INTEGRATED_SECURITY`|`SQL_IS_INTEGER`|`SQL_IS_OFF`,`SQL_IS_ON`|`SQL_IS_OFF`|_Deprecated_; use `SQL_COPT_SS_AUTHENTICATION` set to `SQL_AU_AD_INTEGRATED` instead. <br><br>Forces use of Windows Authentication (Kerberos on Linux and macOS) for access validation on server login. When Windows Authentication is used, the driver ignores user identifier and password values provided as part of `SQLConnect`, `SQLDriverConnect`, or `SQLBrowseConnect` processing.|

## UI Additions for Azure Active Directory (Windows driver only)

The DSN setup and connection UIs of the driver have been enhanced with the additional options necessary for using authentication with Azure AD.

### Creating and editing DSNs in the UI

It is possible to use the new Azure AD authentication options when creating or editing an existing DSN using the driver's setup UI:

`Authentication=ActiveDirectoryIntegrated` for Azure Active Directory Integrated authentication to Azure SQL Database

![The DSN creation and editing screen with Azure Active Directory Integrated authentication selected.](windows/create-dsn-ad-integrated.png)

`Authentication=ActiveDirectoryPassword` for Azure Active Directory username/password authentication to Azure SQL Database

![The DSN creation and editing screen with Azure Active Directory Password authentication selected.](windows/create-dsn-ad-password.png)

`Authentication=ActiveDirectoryInteractive` for Azure Active Directory interactive authentication to Azure SQL Database

![The DSN creation and editing screen with Azure Active Directory Interactive authentication selected.](windows/create-dsn-ad-interactive.png)

`Authentication=SqlPassword` for username/password authentication to SQL Server (Azure or otherwise)

![The DSN creation and editing screen with SQL Server authentication selected.](windows/create-dsn-ad-sql-server.png)

`Trusted_Connection=Yes` for Windows legacy SSPI integrated authentication

![The DSN creation and editing screen with Integrated Windows authentication selected.](windows/create-dsn-win-sspi.png)

`Authentication=ActiveDirectoryMsi` for Azure Active Directory Managed Identity authentication

![The DSN creation and editing screen with Managed Service Identity authentication selected.](windows/create-dsn-ad-msi.png)

`Authentication=ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal` for Azure Active Directory service principal authentication

![The DSN creation and editing screen with Azure Active Directory service principal authentication selected.](windows/create-dsn-ad-spa.png)

The seven options correspond to `Trusted_Connection=Yes` (existing legacy Windows SSPI-only integrated authentication) and `Authentication=` `ActiveDirectoryIntegrated`, `SqlPassword`, `ActiveDirectoryPassword`, `ActiveDirectoryInteractive`, `ActiveDirectoryMsi`, and `ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal` respectively.

### SQLDriverConnect Prompt (Windows driver only)

The prompt dialog displayed by SQLDriverConnect when it requests information required to complete the connection contains four new options for Azure AD authentication:

![The SQL Server Login dialog displayed by SQLDriverConnect.](windows/server-login.png)

These options correspond to the same six available in the DSN setup UI above.

### Example connection strings
1. SQL Server Authentication - legacy syntax. Server certificate is not validated, and encryption is used only if the server enforces it. The username/password is passed in the connection string.
`server=Server;database=Database;UID=UserName;PWD=Password;`
2. SQL Authentication - new syntax. The client requests encryption (the default value of `Encrypt` is `true`) and the server certificate gets validated, regardless of the encryption setting (unless `TrustServerCertificate` is set to `true`). The username/password is passed in the connection string.
 `server=Server;database=Database;UID=UserName;PWD=Password;Authentication=SqlPassword;`
3. Integrated Windows Authentication (Kerberos on Linux and macOS) using SSPI (to SQL Server or SQL IaaS) - current syntax. Server certificate is not validated, unless encryption is used. 
`server=Server;database=Database;Trusted_Connection=yes;`
4. (_Windows driver only_.) Integrated Windows Authentication using SSPI (if the target database is in SQL Server or SQL IaaS) - new syntax. The client requests encryption (the default value of `Encrypt` is `true`) and the server certificate gets validated, regardless of the encryption setting (unless `TrustServerCertificate` is set to `true`). 
`server=Server;database=Database;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryIntegrated;`
5. Azure Active Directory Username/Password Authentication (if the target database is in Azure SQL Database). Server certificate gets validated, regardless of the encryption setting (unless `TrustServerCertificate` is set to `true`). The username/password is passed in the connection string. 
`server=Server;database=Database;UID=UserName;PWD=Password;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryPassword;`
6. (_Windows, and Linux/macOS 17.6+, driver only_.) Integrated Windows Authentication using ADAL or Kerberos, which involves redeeming Windows account credentials for an Azure AD-issued access token, assuming the target database is in Azure SQL Database. Server certificate gets validated, regardless of the encryption setting (unless `TrustServerCertificate` is set to `true`). On Linux/macOS, a suitable Kerberos ticket needs to be available; see the section below on Federated Accounts and [Using Integrated Authentication](linux-mac/using-integrated-authentication.md) for more information.
`server=Server;database=Database;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryIntegrated;`
7. (_Windows driver only_.) Azure AD Interactive Authentication uses Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication technology to set up connection. In this mode, by providing the login ID, an Azure Authentication dialog is triggered and allows the user to input the password to complete the connection. The username is passed in the connection string.
`server=Server;database=Database;UID=UserName;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryInteractive;`

![Windows Azure Authentication UI when using Active Directory Interactive authentication.](windows/WindowsAzureAuth.png)

8. Azure Active Directory Managed Identity Authentication uses system-assigned or user-assigned identity for authentication to set up connection. For user-assigned identity, UID is set to the object ID of the user identity.<br>
For system-assigned identity,<br>
`server=Server;database=Database;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryMsi;`<br>
For user-assigned identity with object ID equals to myObjectId,<br>
`server=Server;database=Database;UID=myObjectId;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryMsi;`

9. Azure Active Directory Service Principal Authentication
`server=Server;databse=Database;UID=clientId;PWD=clientSecret;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryServicePrincipal;`

> [!NOTE]
>- When using the Active Directory options with the Windows ODBC driver ***prior to*** version 17.4.2, ensure that the [Active Directory Authentication Library for SQL Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=513072) has been installed. When using the Linux and macOS drivers, ensure that `libcurl` has been installed. For driver version 17.2 and later, this is not an explicit dependency since it is not required for the other authentication methods or ODBC operations.
>- When Azure Active Directory configuration includes Conditional Access policies, and the client is Windows 10 or Server 2016 or later, authentication via Integrated or username/password may fail. Conditional Access policies require the use of Windows Account Manager (WAM), which is supported in driver version 17.6 or later for Windows. To use WAM, create a new string or DWORD value named `ADALuseWAM` in `HKLM\Software\ODBC\ODBCINST.INI\ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server`, `HKCU\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI\<your-user-DSN-name>`, or `HKLM\Software\ODBC\ODBC.INI\<your-system-DSN-name>` for global, user DSN, or system DSN-scoped configuration respectively, and set it to a value of 1. Note that authentication with WAM does not support running the application as a different user with `runas`. Scenarios which require Condtitional Access policies are not supported for Linux or macOS.
>- To connect using a SQL Server account username and password, you may now use the new `SqlPassword` option, which is recommended especially for Azure SQL since this option enables more secure connection defaults.
>- To connect using an Azure Active Directory account username and password, specify `Authentication=ActiveDirectoryPassword` in the connection string and the `UID` and `PWD` keywords with the username and password, respectively.
>- To connect using Windows Integrated or Active Directory Integrated (Windows, and Linux/macOS 17.6+, driver only) authentication, specify `Authentication=ActiveDirectoryIntegrated` in the connection string. The driver will choose the correct authentication mode automatically. `UID` and `PWD` must not be specified.
>- To connect using Active Directory Interactive (Windows driver only) authentication, `UID` must be specified.

## Authenticating with an Access Token

The `SQL_COPT_SS_ACCESS_TOKEN` pre-connection attribute allows the use of an access token obtained from Azure AD for authentication instead of username and password, and also bypasses the negotiation and obtaining of an access token by the driver. To use an access token, set the `SQL_COPT_SS_ACCESS_TOKEN` connection attribute to a pointer to an `ACCESSTOKEN` structure:

~~~
typedef struct AccessToken
{
    DWORD dataSize;
    BYTE data[];
} ACCESSTOKEN;
~~~

The `ACCESSTOKEN` is a variable-length structure consisting of a 4-byte _length_ followed by _length_ bytes of opaque data that form the access token. Due to how SQL Server handles access tokens, one obtained via an [OAuth 2.0](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios) JSON response must be expanded so that each byte is followed by a 0 padding byte, similar to a UCS-2 string containing only ASCII characters; however, the token is an opaque value and the length specified, in bytes, must NOT include any null terminator. Because of their considerable length and format constraints, this method of authentication is only available programmatically via the `SQL_COPT_SS_ACCESS_TOKEN` connection attribute; there is no corresponding DSN or connection string keyword. The connection string must not contain `UID`, `PWD`, `Authentication`, or `Trusted_Connection` keywords.

> [!NOTE]
> The ODBC Driver version 13.1 only supports this authentication on _Windows_.

## Azure Active Directory Authentication Sample Code

The following sample shows the code required to connect to SQL Server using Azure Active Directory with connection keywords. Note that there is no need to change the application code itself; the connection string, or DSN if one is used, is the only modification needed to use Azure AD for authentication:
~~~
    ...
    SQLCHAR connString[] = "Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server={server};UID=myuser;PWD=myPass;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryPassword"
    ...
    SQLDriverConnect(hDbc, NULL, connString, SQL_NTS, NULL, 0, NULL, SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT);    
    ...
~~~
The following sample shows the code required to connect to SQL Server using Azure Active Directory with access token authentication. In this case, it is necessary to modify application code to process the access token and set the associated connection attribute.
~~~
    SQLCHAR connString[] = "Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server={server}"
    SQLCHAR accessToken[] = "eyJ0eXAiOi..."; // In the format extracted from an OAuth JSON response
    ...
    DWORD dataSize = 2 * strlen(accessToken);
    ACCESSTOKEN *pAccToken = malloc(sizeof(ACCESSTOKEN) + dataSize);
    pAccToken->dataSize = dataSize;
    // Expand access token with padding bytes
    for(int i = 0, j = 0; i < dataSize; i += 2, j++) {
        pAccToken->data[i] = accessToken[j];
        pAccToken->data[i+1] = 0;
    }
    ...
    SQLSetConnectAttr(hDbc, SQL_COPT_SS_ACCESS_TOKEN, (SQLPOINTER)pAccToken, SQL_IS_POINTER);
    SQLDriverConnect(hDbc, NULL, connString, SQL_NTS, NULL, 0, NULL, SQL_DRIVER_NOPROMPT);        
    ...
    free(pAccToken);
~~~
The following is a sample connection string for use with Azure Active Directory Interactive Authentication. Note that it does not contain PWD field as the password would be entered using Azure Authentication screen.
~~~
SQLCHAR connString[] = "Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server={server};UID=myuser;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryInteractive"
~~~
The following is a sample connection string for use with Azure Active Directory Managed Identity Authentication. Note that UID is set to the object ID of the user identity for user-assigned identity.
~~~
// For system-assigned identity,
SQLCHAR connString[] = "Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server={server};Authentication=ActiveDirectoryMsi"
...
// For user-assigned identity with object ID equals to myObjectId
SQLCHAR connString[] = "Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server={server};UID=myObjectId;Authentication=ActiveDirectoryMsi"
~~~

## Considerations for using ADFS Federated Accounts on Linux/macOS

Starting with version 17.6, the drivers for Linux and macOS support authentication using Azure Active Directory ADFS-federated accounts using either username/password (`ActiveDirectoryPassword`) or Kerberos (`ActiveDirectoryIntegrated`). There are some limitations dependent on the platform when using Integrated mode.

When authenticating with a user whose UPN suffix is different from the Kerberos realm, i.e. an alternate UPN suffix is in use, it is necessary to use the Enterprise Principal option (use the `-E` option with `kinit`, and supply the principal name in the form `user@federated-domain`) when obtaining Kerberos tickets. This allows the driver to correctly determine both the federated domain and the Kerberos realm.

You can verify that a suitable Kerberos ticket is available by inspecting the output of the `klist` command. If the federated domain is the same as the Kerberos realm and UPN suffix, the principal name will be of the form `user@realm`. If it is different, the principal name should be of the form `user@federated-domain@realm`.

### Linux

On SuSE 11, the default Kerberos library version of 1.6.x does not support the Enterprise Principal option necessary to use alternate UPN suffixes. To use alternate UPN suffixes with Azure AD Integrated authentication, upgrade the Kerberos library to 1.7 or newer.

On Alpine Linux, the default `libcurl` does not support the SPNEGO/Kerberos authentication required for Azure AD Integrated authentication.

### macOS

The system Kerberos library `kinit` supports Enterprise Principal with the `--enterprise` option, but also implicitly performs name canonicalization, which prevents the use of alternate UPN suffixes. To use alternate UPN suffixes with Azure AD Integrated authentication, install a newer Kerberos library via `brew install krb5` and use its `kinit` with the `-E` option as described above.
